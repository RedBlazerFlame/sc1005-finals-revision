# sc1005-finals-revision
Verilog Code for Revision for NTU's SC1005 Digital Logic Course. Includes code for mealy and moore FSMs, and more!

The code has been tested with Icarus Verilog and GTKWave. If you have the necessary tooling, you may opt to run the code in this repository yourself.

Note that writing the testbench files (ending in `_tb.v`) is *not* examinable in SC1005. Feel free to skip these during your first reading.
